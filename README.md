ðŸŽ¸ Guitar Store Website

This project was created as part of a school lesson where we learned how to build a website together with our teacher.
Itâ€™s my first proper website, and I used HTML and CSS (Grid layout) to create a simple product page for guitars.

The goal of this task was to practice:
	â€¢	Structuring a webpage using semantic HTML
	â€¢	Styling with CSS
	â€¢	Using CSS Grid for layout
	â€¢	Understanding basic responsive design

ðŸ’¡ This was my introduction to building and designing real websites â€” and Iâ€™m proud of how it turned out!
